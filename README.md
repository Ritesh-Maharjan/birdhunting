Play the game by going to this link: https://riteshmaharjan.com/shootingduck/

Bird hunting is a game which copies the idea of duck hunt game. Basically in this game you will be shooting birds and make it so that it won't go up in the sky. This game was created using HTML5 canvas a bit of css for simple design and javascript for the functionality. The sole purpose of the game was to have fun and learning canvas with javascript in the HTML.

I have soley worked on the project but have taken sound and images from different sources which is attributed in credits page.
